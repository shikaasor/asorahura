## Codebase Patterns
- Use `npx tsc --noEmit` for typecheck validation (not `npm run build`)
- CSS modules pattern: Import as `styles` and apply via `className={styles.name}`
- Client components: Add `"use client"` directive when using framer-motion, hooks, or browser APIs
- Animation pattern: framer-motion with `motion.div` + `initial/animate/transition` props
- Typography: Playfair Display (serif) for headlines/h tags, Inter (sans-serif) for body/UI
- Design tokens: CSS custom properties defined in globals.css (--foreground, --background, --muted, etc.)
- Page sections: Wrapper with className + nested .container div for consistent max-width
- Grid layouts: 3 columns desktop (repeat(3, 1fr)), collapse to 1 column at 1024px breakpoint
- Section spacing: 10rem vertical padding, alternating backgrounds (white, #f9fafb)
- Fixed navigation requires pages to have top padding (currently 15rem on hero sections)
- Active link detection: Use `usePathname()` hook and conditional className comparison

## 2026-01-25 16:15 - US-001
- Verified all acceptance criteria for Project Setup & Infrastructure
- All infrastructure components already in place and functional
- Files verified:
  - package.json: Next.js, React, MDX dependencies configured
  - tsconfig.json: TypeScript with strict mode enabled
  - .eslintrc.json: ESLint with Next.js config
  - next.config.mjs: MDX integration configured
  - src/app/globals.css: Design tokens and typography defined
  - src/app/layout.tsx: Google Fonts (Inter & Playfair Display) loaded
- Typecheck validation: npx tsc --noEmit passes successfully
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The project uses CSS custom properties (CSS variables) for design tokens in globals.css
  - Typography setup: Playfair Display for headlines (serif), Inter for UI/body (sans-serif)
  - Color palette: High-contrast light theme with subtle grid background for lab aesthetic
  - Font loading pattern: Next.js font optimization with variable assignment in layout.tsx
  - MDX is configured via next.config.mjs with @next/mdx wrapper
  - Quality checks: Use `npx tsc --noEmit` for typecheck validation

## 2026-01-25 16:20 - US-002
- Verified Global Navigation & Layout implementation
- Navigation component already exists and meets all requirements
- Files reviewed:
  - src/components/Navigation.tsx: Client component with framer-motion animations
  - src/components/Navigation.module.css: Responsive styling with mobile breakpoint
  - All route pages exist: /, /work, /flowmorph, /engage
- Features verified:
  - Fixed navigation with backdrop blur for modern aesthetic
  - Active state highlighting using usePathname hook
  - Serif font for logo (brand consistency)
  - CTA styling for "Engage" link
  - Mobile responsive (768px breakpoint)
- Typecheck validation: npx tsc --noEmit passes successfully
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Navigation uses "use client" directive for framer-motion and usePathname
  - Active link detection pattern: pathname comparison with conditional className
  - CSS module pattern: Import styles and apply via className={styles.name}
  - Animation pattern: framer-motion's motion.div with initial/animate/transition props
  - Fixed nav requires body padding-top adjustment (check if pages account for this)
  - The navigation is globally included in layout.tsx

## 2026-01-25 16:30 - US-003
- Completed Home Page - Authority Hub by adding missing "What I Do" section
- Files modified:
  - src/app/page.tsx: Added whatIDo section with three items
  - src/app/page.module.css: Added .whatIDo, .whatIDoGrid, .whatIDoItem styles
- Section content:
  - AI Automation Architecture: Unstructured data processing and autonomous agents
  - Compliance-First Automation: Auditable systems for regulated industries
  - Process Orchestration: System integration and workflow automation
- All existing sections verified:
  - Hero: "Transforming Work into Flow" with CTAs
  - Problem: Operational Friction, Cognitive Overload, Scaling Debt
  - Philosophy: Systems > Tools, Flow > Optimization, Automation = Liberation
  - Proof Signals: Technical Artifacts, SaaS Demos, GitHub References
  - Bridge: Link to Flowmorph
- Typecheck validation: npx tsc --noEmit passes successfully
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Page sections follow consistent pattern: section wrapper with container inside
  - Grid layouts use 3-column desktop, 1-column mobile pattern
  - Section backgrounds alternate: white, #f9fafb for visual rhythm
  - All sections use 10rem vertical padding for consistent spacing
  - Media queries at 1024px collapse grids to single column
  - Typography: h3 uses serif font at 1.5rem, paragraphs use muted color

## 2026-01-25 16:45 - US-004
- Enhanced Flowmorph Page - Agency Engine with missing sections
- Files modified:
  - src/app/flowmorph/page.tsx: Added audience section, refactored services
  - src/app/flowmorph/flowmorph.module.css: Added styles for new sections
- Changes made:
  - Refactored Services section from list to card grid with detailed descriptions
  - Added "Who Flowmorph Is For" section with target audience criteria
  - Enhanced service cards: IDP, AI Agent Systems, High-Volume, Process Orchestration
  - Audience filter includes: High-volume ops, Scaling startups, Regulated industries
  - Clear positioning statement filtering out off-the-shelf SaaS seekers

  - Hero with distinct Flowmorph branding and logo
  - Philosophy cards: Automation ≠ scripts, Systems > Tools, Humans create/machines execute
  - Methodology: 4-step engagement model (Diagnosis -> Design -> Deployment -> Optimization)
  - CTA section with "High-value, limited engagements only"
- Typecheck validation: npx tsc --noEmit passes successfully
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Flowmorph page has its own nav (not using global Navigation component)
  - Services can be displayed as grid cards (2-column) instead of list for better UX
  - Audience filtering is explicit: helps qualify leads before contact
  - Border-left pattern for emphasis blocks (.audienceFilter)
  - 2-column service grid collapses to 1-column at 1024px

## 2026-01-25 17:00 - US-005
- Enhanced Work / Systems Page with case studies and disclaimer

  - Border-left accent pattern works well for emphasis (.disclaimer, .caseStudy)
  - Strong tags within text for field labels (Context:, Bottleneck:, etc.)
  - System entries maintain flex layout with diagram on right side
  - Case studies add credibility while protecting client confidentiality
